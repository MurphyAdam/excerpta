Bugs I ran into and their fixes:

1 bug:
AssertionError: `HyperlinkedIdentityField` requires the request in the serializer context. Add `context={'request': request}` when instantiating the serializer.

1 fix:

if you keep getting a HyperlinkedRelatedField needs a request context even after changing your serializers to be using ModelSerializer and PrimaryKeyRelatedField (your UserSerializer), check if the fiedls list of your meta class has a 'url' property, if so, remove it.
